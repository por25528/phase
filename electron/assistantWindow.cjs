// Pure description of the assistant shelf window, kept out of main.cjs so
// its shape is unit-testable without an Electron runtime.

const path = require('node:path')

// Compact and fixed: the shelf is 620 wide and never grows, so a long list
// stays inside the pane instead of forming a tower under the shortcut.
//
// HEIGHT is a BUDGET, not the size of the pane. The card sizes to its own
// content (see `shelfSizing`), so a short state no longer paints the leftover
// space — on macOS the window behind it is transparent and a click there
// closes the shelf. What this number still has to guarantee is that the
// TALLEST state fits: a hugging card is clipped by the window edge rather than
// scrolled, so anything past this line is not merely awkward, it is invisible.
//
// The tallest state is a running session parked in `confirming`, with its goal
// title, an "Other options" row AND a notice above it — 218.8px at 620 wide.
// The notice is what moved this number: it used to REPLACE the body and now
// sits above it, so it adds a line to whatever is already there. The same
// session without the notice is 190.6px, which is why 192 held until now.
//
// MEASURED, never derived. Arithmetic against the type scale put this number
// 20px low once already. If a state grows, measure it again.
